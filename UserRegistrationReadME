Creating new user - there will be no registration form,
 'cos every student and employee must be in system automatically.
 We added username and password generation, so there no need in registration user
 or admin can do it manually via database

 For every employee and student username and password will be provided
Admin can change password and username straightly in database, there is no need for such option on this lvl project
